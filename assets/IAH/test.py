# Percel is the courant number (i.e., the number of cells, or a fraction of a cell) advection will
#   be allowed in any direction in one transport step. for implicit finite-difference or
#   particle-tracking-based schemes, there is no limit on percel, but for accuracy reasons, it is
#   generally not set much greater than one. note, however, that the percel limit is checked over
#   the entire model grid. thus, even if percel > 1, advection may not be more than one cell's
#   length at most model locations. for the explicit finite-difference or the third-order tvd
#   scheme, percel is also a stability constraint which must not exceed one and will be
#   automatically reset to one if a value greater than one is specified.

# Itrack is a flag indicating which particle-tracking algorithm is selected for the

#   needed only when percel is set greater than one. = 3, the hybrid first- and fourth-order
#   algorithm is used; the runge-kutta algorithm is used in sink/source cells and the cells next to

itrack = None
# Is a concentration weighting factor between 0.5 and 1. it is used for operator splitting in the
#   particle- tracking-based methods. the value of 0.5 is generally adequate. the value of wd may
#   be adjusted to achieve better mass balance. generally, it can be increased toward 1.0 as
#   advection becomes more dominant.
wd = None
# Is a small relative cell concentration gradient below which advective transport is considered
dceps = None
# Nplane is a flag indicating whether the random or fixed pattern is selected for initial placement
#   of moving particles. if nplane = 0, the random pattern is selected for initial placement.
#   particles are distributed randomly in both the horizontal and vertical directions by calling a
#   random number generator (figure 18b). this option is usually preferred and leads to smaller
#   mass balance discrepancy in nonuniform or diverging/converging flow fields. if nplane > 0, the
#   fixed pattern is selected for initial placement. the value of nplane serves as the number of
#   vertical 'planes' on which initial particles are placed within each cell block (figure 18a).
#   the fixed pattern may work better than the random pattern only in relatively uniform flow
#   fields. for two-dimensional simulations in plan view, set nplane = 1. for cross sectional or
#   three-dimensional simulations, nplane = 2 is normally adequate. increase nplane if more
#   resolution in the vertical direction is desired.
nplane = None
# Npl is the number of initial particles per cell to be placed at cells where the relative cell
#   concentration gradient is less than or equal to dceps. generally, npl can be set to zero since
#   advection is considered insignificant when the relative cell concentration gradient is less
#   than or equal to dceps. setting npl equal to nph causes a uniform number of particles to be
#   placed in every cell over the entire grid (i.e., the uniform approach).
npl = None
# Nph is the number of initial particles per cell to be placed at cells where the relative cell
#   concentration gradient is greater than dceps. the selection of nph depends on the nature of the
#   flow field and also the computer memory limitation. generally, a smaller number should be used
#   in relatively uniform flow fields and a larger number should be used in relatively nonuniform
#   flow fields. however, values exceeding 16 in two-dimensional simulation or 32 in three-
#   dimensional simulation are rarely necessary. if the random pattern is chosen, nph particles are
#   randomly distributed within the cell block. if the fixed pattern is chosen, nph is divided by
#   nplane to yield the number of particles to be placed per vertical plane, which is rounded to
#   one of the values shown in figure 30.
nph = None
# Is the minimum number of particles allowed per cell. if the number of particles in a cell at the
#   end of a transport step is fewer than npmin, new particles are inserted into that cell to
#   maintain a sufficient number of particles. npmin can be set to zero in relatively uniform flow
#   fields and to a number greater than zero in diverging/converging flow fields. generally, a
#   value between zero and four is adequate.
npmin = None
# Npmax is the maximum number of particles allowed per cell. if the number of particles in a cell
#   exceeds npmax, all particles are removed from that cell and replaced by a new set of particles
#   equal to nph to maintain mass balance. generally, npmax can be set to approximately two times
#   of nph.
npmax = None
# S a flag indicating whether the random or fixed pattern is selected for initial placement of
#   particles to approximate sink cells in the mmoc scheme. the convention is the same as that for
#   nplane. it is generally adequate to set nlsink equivalent to nplane.

#   either moc or mmoc in the hmoc solution scheme. the moc solution is selected at cells where the

# To activate the component-dependent diffusion option, a keyword input record must be inserted to

#   keyword input record, comment lines marked by the symbol # in the first column are allowed.
#   comment lines are processed but have no effect on the simulation. furthermore, blank lines are
#   also acceptable above the keyword input record. below the keyword input record, the format of
#   the dsp input file must remain unchanged from the previous versions except for the diffusion
#   coefficient as explained below. if no keyword input record is specified, the input file remains
#   backward compatible with all previous versions of mt3dms. the predefined keyword for the

#   needs to specify one diffusion coefficient for each mobile solute component and at each model

# Crch is the concentration of recharge for species 1. if the recharge flux is positive, it acts as
#   a source whose concentration can be specified as desired. if the recharge flux is negative, it
#   acts as a sink (discharge) whose concentration is always set equal to the concentration of
#   groundwater at the cell where discharge occurs. note that the location and flow rate of
#   recharge/discharge are obtained from the flow model directly through the unformatted
#   flow-transport link file.  crch can be specified as an array, if the array is constant for the
#   entire simulation.  if crch changes by stress period, then the user must provide a dictionary,
#   where the key is the stress period number (zero based) and the value is the recharge array.
#   the recharge concentration can be specified for additional species by passing additional
#   arguments to the mt3dssm constructor.  for example, to specify the recharge concentration for
#   species two one could use crch2={0: 0., 1: 10*np.ones((nrow, ncol), dtype=np.float)} as and
#   additional keyword argument that is passed to mt3dssm when making the ssm object.

# Is the concentration of evapotranspiration flux for species 1. evapotranspiration is the only
#   type of sink whose concentration may be specified externally. note that the concentration of a
#   sink cannot be greater than that of the aquifer at the sink cell. thus, if the sink
#   concentration is specified greater than that of the aquifer, it is automatically set equal to
#   the concentration of the aquifer. also note that the location and flow rate of
#   evapotranspiration are obtained from the flow model directly through the unformatted
#   flow-transport link file.  for multi-species simulations, see crch for a description of how to
#   specify additional concentrations arrays for each species.

# Keys in the dictionary are stress zero-based stress period numbers; values in the dictionary are
#   recarrays of ssm boundaries.  the dtype for the recarray can be obtained using ssm.dtype (after
#   the ssm package has been created).  the default dtype for the recarray is np.dtype([('k',
#   np.int), ("i", np.int), ("j", np.int), ("css", np.float32), ("itype", np.int), ((cssms(n),
#   np.float), n=1, ncomp)]) if there are more than one component species, then additional entries
#   will be added to the dtype as indicated by cssm(n). note that if the number of dictionary
#   entries is less than the number of stress periods, then the last recarray of boundaries will
#   apply until the end of the simulation. full details of all options to specify
#   stress_period_data can be found in the flopy3_multi-component_ssm ipython notebook in the
#   notebook subdirectory of the examples directory. css is the specified source concentration or
#   mass-loading rate, depending on the value of itype, in a single-species simulation, (for a
#   multispecies simulation, css is not used, but a dummy value still needs to be entered here.)
#   note that for most types of sources, css is interpreted as the source concentration with the
#   unit of mass per unit volume (ml-3), which, when multiplied by its corresponding flow rate
#   (l3t-1) from the flow model, yields the mass-loading rate (mt-1) of the source. for a special
#   type of sources (itype = 15), css is taken directly as the mass-loading rate (mt-1) of the
#   source so that no flow rate is required from the flow model. furthermore, if the source is
#   specified as a constant-concentration cell (itype = -1), the specified value of css is assigned
#   directly as the concentration of the designated cell. if the designated cell is also associated
#   with a sink/source term in the flow model, the flow rate is not used. itype is an integer
#   indicating the type of the point source.  an itype dictionary can be retrieved from the ssm
#   object as itype = mt3d.mt3dssm.itype_dict() (cssms(n), n=1, ncomp) defines the concentrations
#   of a point source for multispecies simulation with ncomp>1. in a multispecies simulation, it is
#   necessary to define the concentrations of all species associated with a point source. as an
#   example, if a chemical of a certain species is injected into a multispecies system, the
#   concentration of that species is assigned a value greater than zero while the concentrations of
#   all other species are assigned zero. cssms(n) can be entered in free format, separated by a
#   comma or space between values. several important notes on assigning concentration for the
#   constant-concentration condition (itype = -1) are listed below: the constant-concentration
#   condition defined in this input file takes precedence to that defined in the basic transport
#   package input file. in a multiple stress period simulation, a constant-concentration cell, once
#   defined, will remain a constant- concentration cell in the duration of the simulation, but its
#   concentration value can be specified to vary in different stress periods. in a multispecies
#   simulation, if it is only necessary to define different constant-concentration conditions for
#   selected species at the same cell location, specify the desired concentrations for those
#   species, and assign a negative value for all other species. the negative value is a flag used
#   by mt3dms to skip assigning the constant-concentration condition for the designated species.
